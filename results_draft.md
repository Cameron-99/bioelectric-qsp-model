    and steady-state voltage as a function of dose, consistent with their original 1980s mechanisms. The model also captures a smooth log–dose response 
for amiloride using PubChem IC50 values, anchoring the rest of the pipeline in real pharmacology data.

2.2 Figures 3–4

    Local changes in channel activity propagate into tissue-scale bioelectric patterns.
    Extending the single-cell model to a simple multicell “tissue” with gap-junction-like 
coupling shows that local 
changes in channel activity produce 
stable or unstable spatial voltage patterns across the tissue. 
In this framework, drugs reshape 
not just individual cell 
voltages but also the 
coherence and stability of tissue-level 
patterns, which align with Levin’s view of 
bioelectric networks as a control 
layer over anatomy.

2.3 Figure 5

    Amiloride and propranolol differentially modulate tissue-level stability.
    Applying amiloride and propranolol in the tissue model changes the stability and uniformity of the emergent voltage patterns in distinct ways, 
despite both drugs originating from 1980s pharmacology. This supports the idea that legacy ion-channel–modulating drugs can be reinterpreted as controllers 
of tissue-level bioelectric states, not just as modulators of single-cell excitability.

2.4 Figure 6

    Evolutionary search reveals parameter degeneracy in achieving a target bioelectric state.
    A DEAP-based evolutionary algorithm searches over kinetic parameters of the bioelectric model to minimize the error between the multicell voltage pattern and a target 
pattern defined by baseline parameters. The algorithm rapidly finds distinct parameter sets that reproduce essentially the same final voltage state, illustrating that multiple 
internal configurations can realize the same tissue-level bioelectric goal state in this model, consistent with 
multiscale competency ideas.
