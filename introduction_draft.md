Paragraph 1: Problem and gap


    Classical 1970s–1980s ion-channel drugs were designed around acute electrophysiology, not long-range morphogenesis or regeneration.

​

Ion channels are now known to regulate development, regeneration, cancer, and neurodegeneration, yet most legacy drugs are not interpreted through this bioelectric lens.


Paragraph 2: Bioelectric control and multiscale competency

​

Cells, tissues, and organs exhibit “multiscale competency,” using bioelectric cues to correct errors and reach target morphologies.


Paragraph 3: Legacy drugs as bioelectric agents



    Many existing drugs modulate ion channels or transporters and thus inevitably perturb these bioelectric control networks.

​

This suggests a repurposing opportunity: treat legacy drugs as levers on tissue-level bioelectric states rather than only as modulators of excitability or symptoms.


Paragraph 4: End by stating what the paper does (match your Results):

    Present a simple quantitative systems pharmacology pipeline that links single-cell channel pharmacology to multicell bioelectric patterns and evolutionary search in parameter space.

​

Using three archetypal drugs (e.g., amiloride, propranolol, ivermectin) to illustrate how legacy agents can be reframed as controllers of bioelectric goal states in a Levin-style multiscale agency framework.
