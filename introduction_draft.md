Paragraph 1: Problem and gap

   
Ion channels are now known to regulate development, regeneration, cancer, and neurodegeneration, yet most legacy drugs are not interpreted through this bioelectric lens.


Paragraph 2: Bioelectric control and multiscale competency


Cells, tissues, and organs exhibit “multiscale competency,” using bioelectric cues to correct errors and reach target morphologies.


Paragraph 3: Legacy drugs as bioelectric agents


This suggests a repurposing opportunity: treat legacy drugs as levers on tissue-level bioelectric states rather than only as modulators of excitability or symptoms.


Paragraph 4:
