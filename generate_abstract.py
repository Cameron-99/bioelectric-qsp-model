ABSTRACT
We computationally repurpose 1980s pharmacology (amiloride, propranolol) 
in Michael Levin's bioelectric agency framework. Multiscale QSP/ABM 
simulations predict tissue voltage gradients and collective decision 
disruption in virtual xenobot/planarian assays (Figures 1-5). This 
lab-free pipeline reveals latent regenerative potentials of legacy 
drugs, bridging reductionist mechanisms with organismal agency.
